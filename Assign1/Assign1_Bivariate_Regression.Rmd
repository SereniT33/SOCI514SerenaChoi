## Bivariate Regression and Residuals

In this assignment, we will perform a bivariate linear regression analysis of the OECD welfare state data. The objective is to test the null hypothesis that governments controlled by left/labor parties do *not* have more egalitarian welfare states. 


### Research question 

This research question asks whether there is a relationship between welfare state development and the legislative & cabinet seat shares for left or labour parties among the OECD countries.

We can write a regression equation: 

*y = B0 + B1x + e* 

where y (response variable) is represented by **decom** and x (explanatory variable) is represented by **left**. 

Our null hypothesis is as follows: 

*H0 = B1 = 0*

which means that the slope of the regression equation is 0.
